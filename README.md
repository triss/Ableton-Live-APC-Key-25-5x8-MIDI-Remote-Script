# AKAI APC Key 25 5x8 - MIDI Remote Script for Ableton Live

This is a MIDI remote script for Ableton Live with a rotated 5 track 8 scene clip launcher.

I always find myself irritated by the orientation of the Clip Launcher on my **AKAI APC Key 25** MIDI Controller. 
This rotates it such that the controller can launch **8 clips on 5 tracks** rather than 5 clips on 8 tracks. 
Scene launching and track manipulation buttons have also been moved accordingly.

All other functionality is the same as the origanal scripts.
